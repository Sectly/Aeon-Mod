# Let's Get Started!

Welcome to **Aeon**, a mod that will take you on a journey through technological advancement and automation in Minecraft! This guidebook is your key to unlocking the full potential of the mod. Follow the steps below to begin your adventure.

## Step 1: Mine Aeon Ore

Your journey begins by discovering the rare and powerful **Aeon Ore**. Found deep underground, this ore is the foundation of everything in the Aeon mod.

{green}Tip:{}
Aeon Ore is slightly rarer than Iron but much more valuable. Keep an eye out for its distinct blue glow!

## Step 2: Smelt Aeon Ingots

Once you've mined some Aeon Ore, it's time to refine it into **Aeon Ingots**. Use a blast furnace to smelt the raw Aeon into its ingot form.

{green}Pro Tip:{}
Smelting Aeon Ore in a blast furnace is faster than a regular furnace.
